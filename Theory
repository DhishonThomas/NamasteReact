What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?

Named Exports:
ğŸ’¥ With named exports, you can export multiple named values (functions, variables, classes, etc.) from a module.

ğŸ’¥ To export something as named export, you use the export keyword followed by the name of the value you want to export.

ğŸ’¥ When importing named exports, you use curly braces {} to destructure the named exports you want to import.


// Exporting module.js
export const myFunction = () => { /* function body */ };
export const myVariable = 'Hello';

// Importing module.js
import { myFunction, myVariable } from './module';



Default Export:
ğŸ’¥ Default exports allow you to export only one value per module.

ğŸ’¥ You use the export default syntax to export a value as default from a module.

ğŸ’¥ When importing a default export, you can choose any name for the imported value.

// Exporting module.js
const myFunction = () => { /* function body */ };
export default myFunction;

// Importing module.js
import myFunction from './module';


* as Export:
ğŸ’¥ The * as syntax allows you to import all named exports from a module as properties of an object.

ğŸ’¥ It's typically used when you want to import multiple named exports from a module but prefer to access them through a single object.


// Exporting module.js
export const foo = () => { /* function body */ };
export const bar = () => { /* function body */ };

// Importing module.js
import * as myModule from './module';
// Now you can access named exports as properties of myModule
myModule.foo();
myModule.bar();


In summary, named exports are useful for exporting multiple values from a module, default export is used when you want to export a single value as the default export, and * as export is used to import multiple named exports from a module and access them through a single object.

What is the importance of config.js file


A `config.js` file serves as a central hub for storing configuration settings in a web application. Its importance lies in:

1. Centralization: It provides a single place to manage configuration settings, making it easier to maintain and update.

2. Environment-specific settings: It allows for the management of environment-specific configurations, such as API endpoints or database credentials, ensuring consistent behavior across different deployment environments.

3. Security: By storing sensitive information separately from the codebase, it helps enhance security and prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data.

4. Deployment flexibility: It facilitates smooth deployment by enabling easy switching of configurations for different environments without modifying the source code.

5. Testing: It aids in testing by providing a way to mock or stub configurations for different testing scenarios, ensuring thorough testing of the application under various conditions.

What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to have stateful logic and access React lifecycle features. They were introduced in React version 16.8. Prior to Hooks, stateful logic and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. Hooks provide a more concise and flexible way to use state and other React features in functional components without the need for class syntax.

There are several built-in hooks provided by React, including:

1. `useState`: Allows functional components to have local state.
2. `useEffect`: Enables performing side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
3. `useContext`: Provides access to the React context within functional components.
4. `useReducer`: An alternative to `useState`, useful for managing more complex state logic.
5. `useRef`: Returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property can be used to persist values across renders.
6. `useCallback` and `useMemo`: Memoize functions and values to optimize performance.
7. `useLayoutEffect`: Similar to `useEffect`, but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.

Custom hooks can also be created, allowing for reusable logic to be shared across components. React Hooks have become a fundamental part of React development, enabling functional components to be more powerful and expressive while retaining simplicity and readability.

Why do we need a useState Hook?



The `useState` hook in React is like a toolbox for functional components. It allows these components to have their own memory, called "state." This memory can hold information that changes over time, like a counter or the text in an input field.

Before hooks, only class components could have this memory. But now, with `useState`, functional components can also remember things.

Why is it important?

1. **Keeps Things Simple:** Functional components are easier to write and understand. `useState` makes them even simpler by allowing them to remember information without converting them into class components.

2. **No More Confusion:** With `useState`, functional components don't need the confusing `this` keyword to access their memory. They can do it directly, making the code clearer.

3. **Better Performance:** Functional components with `useState` can often run faster than class components because React can optimize them more efficiently.

In a nutshell, `useState` is like a magic spell that gives functional components the power to remember things. It keeps the code simple, reduces confusion, and makes everything run faster.
